 * absolute flex item, it is based soley on "flex" not content.
 *
 * flex-basis: 0; -> grow to fit the available space.
 * When there are two or more flex-items with zero based flex-basis values, they share the spacing available based on the flex-grow values.
 * widths arenâ€™t computed based on content size. The widths are based on the flex value specified.
